/// This is taken from the model project https://github.com/lucavenir/go_router_riverpod,
/// that is a repo containing the "best" solution to integrate GoRouter and Riverpod together
///
/// A [Listenable] implemented via an [AsyncNotifier].
/// [GoRouter] accepts a [Listenable] to refresh its internal state, so this is kinda mandatory.
///
/// An alternative would be to register a dependency via an Inherited Widget, but that's kinda a no-go for Riverpod.
///
/// To sync Riverpod' state with this Listener, we simply accept and call a single callback on authentication change.
/// Obviously, more logic could be implemented here, this is meant to be a simple example.
///
/// I kinda like this example, as this allows to centralize global redirecting logic in one class.
///
/// SIDE NOTES.
/// This might look overcomplicated at a first glance;
/// Instead, this method aims to follow some good some good practices:
///   1. It doesn't require us to pass [Ref](s) around
///   2. It works as a complete replacement for [ChangeNotifier], as it still implements [Listenable]
///   3. It allows for listening to multiple providers, or add more logic if needed
